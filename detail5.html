        <h3>James Nares: Portraits</h3>

         Nares, a British artist turned New Yorker, has be a fixture of the art world since the late '70s. In recent years, he's been recognized mostly for elegantly expansive paintings centered around single brushstrokes made with what must be a gargantuan brush (or maybe a mop). He's also a filmmaker, and in 2013, The Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited his video, Street, a ultra slow-motion panorama of pedestrians going about their business. Lyrical and haunting, Street, which was scored by former Sonic Youth frontman Thurston Moore, was shot from the back of a moving truck. His latest show also involves slow-motion video, this time as a medium for portraits of friends and family captured in high-resolution detail. The results exist somewhere in a liminal space between still and moving pictures.
