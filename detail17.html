        <h3>Ann Christopher RA: Drawings-The Lines of Time</h3>
        <h3>February 25, 2016 - May 29, 2016</h3>
        <h3>Royal Academy of Art</h3>
        
        <p class="big" style="color:#909090">
         Ann Christopher RA began this project while working in Southern France near the town of Albi. She describes the forms represented as originating from her experience of the "ever-changing effects of the climate and light on the landscape" in that area.

The drawings, which have never previously been exhibited together, continue Christopher's exploration of line - a theme that connects her non-figurative sculpture, drawings and prints.
