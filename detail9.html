         LeRone Wilson's inaugural solo exhibition with gallery nine 5, Universal Journey is on view through March 6, 2016. The show illustrates Wilson's mastery over encaustic painting, a technique that dates back to the 1st century and was most notably used in the Fayum mummy portraits and later in the Byzantine icon, Blachernitissa. Using heated beeswax and pigment, Wilson creates heavily-worked surfaces that have a sculptural quality. The show guides the viewer through a visual story of our existence while leading them through the artists' own self-actualization. Through his work, Wilson highlights this journey while also adding his own perspective, not just as an artist and as a storyteller, but also as an African American in a quest to reclaim the spiritual and cultural identity of his ancestors ? an identity that has been distorted and buried in the sands of time.

The obscuring of the Black identity has plagued the African American community for centuries. Accomplishments and contributions by gifted individuals such as inventor Elijah McCoy and Olympian Wilma Rudolph have been all-but erased from the history books. In religion, Christianity-a dominant facet in the African-American community-fixes its focus on a fair-skinned Christ. In pop culture, films such as Exodus: Gods and Kings and the upcoming Gods of Egypt serve to inhume historical facts and perpetuate falsehoods by employing predominantly Caucasian casts. This so called "whitewashing" of history and culture has resulted in a tradition of mis-education. Through his work Wilson seeks to undo these errors in history.

Ever the innovationist, Wilson takes the encaustic technique a step further, experimenting with texture, volume and movement. His process is akin to his self-discovery, Wilson builds the material then removes the excess, only to add and rebuild the wax into a desired form. The result is a new genre aptly dubbed sculpture painting. In Homage to Ra, Wilson uses his signature technique to once again reference his cultural and spiritual roots while taking the opportunity to display his carefully honed skill. Depicting a blazing sun that almost burns brighter than the one in the sky, the work is a prime example of the dynamism of Wilson's aesthetic.

Wilson's works engage the senses and demand a response while simultaneously lulling the viewer into an introspective trance that inspires a philosophical awakening. Through visual narrative, these pieces beget a progressive dialogue that allows the audience to experience what it means to encounter their own truth.

Universal Journey is a window into personal evolution; a visual translation of the metaphysical flowering of the mind, wrought by the hands of an artist who is challenging the viewer to embark on an introspective journey of self.
