        <h3>History of Nothing</h3>
        <h3>February 3, 2016 - April 17, 2016</h3>
        <h3>White Cube Gallery</h3>
        
        <p class="big" style="color:#909090">
         White Cube is pleased to present the group show 'History of Nothing'. Titled after a 1962 film by Eduardo Paolozzi, the exhibition explores the idea of the 'supersized' American dream and features the work of Thomas Bayrle, Katherine Bernhardt, Mike Bouchet, Nicholas Cheveldave, Anthea Hamilton, Eloise Hawser, Zak Kitnick, Josh Kline, Josephine Meckseper, Eduardo Paolozzi and Timur Si Qin.

In his seminal film History of Nothing, Paolozzi creates a complex sequence of objects, architecture and landscapes, collaged together and accompanied by sounds. This layering of images serves to enhance and exploit the surreal and uncanny in mass media, everyday objects and the mechanical processes of industrial production. Continuing this vernacular, the artists in this exhibition employ branding strategies and use consumer iconography to explore the increasingly insatiable appetite for acquisition, whether material, cultural or ideological.

All of the artists display a critical awareness of global commercialism, resulting in works that are often darkly humorous. Mike Bouchet's painting of a cowboy coming down a mountain riding a bull, for example, references the classic Americana image of 'Marlboro Man'. A testament to the reach of consumerism, the work is painted using Diet Coca-Cola, the quintessential American soft-drink. Timur Si Qin continues the idea of a usurped landscape in his light box works, part of the ongoing 'Peace' campaign series. Depicting a 'mythical futuristic' place, the landscape assumes the role of protagonist in an undisclosed narrative, where the outcome will inevitably be at natures' expense.
