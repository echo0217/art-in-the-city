        <p class="big" style="color:#909090">
         The Serpentine presents the first major exhibition of work by Kerstin Bratsch and Adele Roder in a UK public institution. Bratsch and Roder are based in New York and London. While each has her own practice, the artists have worked collaboratively as DAS INSTITUT since 2007.The exhibition at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery presents works resulting from their collaboration as well as pieces from their individual practices.
In her work, Bratsch uses painting to question the ways in which the body can be expressed - psychologically, physically and socially - while Roder searches for basic symbolic forms to create a non-verbal language utilising clothing, posture and light. As DAS INSTITUT the artists attempt to communicate the inexpressible - the intuitive, irrational element of human experience and relationships.
