        <h3>Tim Hawkinson: Counterclockwise</h3>
        <h3>February 29, 2016 - April 23, 2016</h3>

        <p class="big" style="color:#909090">
         This show spans 20 years of work by this Los Angeles artist whose metier is creating elaborately mechanized sculptures and installations. They've included a stadium-size bagpipe and a school desk equipped with a contraption that continuously pens the artist's signature on slips of paper as they get spat out on the floor. Hawkinson often engages in a kind of self-portraiture based on his body and its dynamics: One piece features a large color photo of is face, in which his mouth and eyes have been hinged, allowing them to change expression through the movement of computer-actuated cables. Eccentric and exacting, Hawkinson's art is the product of one of the most idiosyncratic artistic minds working today.
