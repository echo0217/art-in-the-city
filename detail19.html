         Datong Dazhang, whose real name was Zhang Shengquan, was born in 1955, in Datong City, Shanxi. Due to his height of 1.9 meters, many people called him "Dazhang" (Big Zhang). Later, he simply adopted the name of "Datong Dazhang."
 
Datong Dazhang stood as a rare model for a significant life within the thirty-year course of Chinese contemporary art. He was a gifted talent, a martyr to art, and a pure creative spirit who adhered to the independent thinking of a wise man and lonely free soul. On the New Year's Eve of 2000, while the whole of mankind was cheering for the arrival of the new millennium, Datong Dazhang hung himself in his apartment. As an important figure documented in the Wen Pulin Archive of Chinese Avant-Garde Art, Datong Dazhang emerged artistically through the 1980s, and never reversed course from the driving force of the avant-garde. In our commercialized present, a careful reading of his message can help us reflect on the current situation of Chinese contemporary art, and its destiny.
 
To mark the 60th anniversary of Datong Dazhang's birth this year, and the 15th anniversary of his death, the Power Station of Art has joined efforts with the Wen Pulin Archive of Chinese Avant-Garde Art, drawing on its collected materials to realize for the first time a large-scale exhibition of his work. This exhibition presents Datong Dazhang's important artistic explorations and thoughts from his short life, highlighting a vision that radiated with incisive rays of critical thinking.
