        <h3>Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse</h3>
        <h3>January 30, 2016 - April 20, 2016</h3>
        <h3>Royal Academy of Art</h3>
        
        <p class="big" style="color:#909090">
         Monet, arguably the most important painter of gardens in the history of art, once said he owed his painting "to flowers". But Monet was far from alone in his fascination with the horticultural world, which is why we will also be bringing you masterpieces by Renoir, Cezanne, Pissarro, Manet, Sargent, Kandinsky, Van Gogh, Matisse, Klimt and Klee.

For these artists and others, the garden gave them the freedom to break new ground and explore the ever-changing world around them. Highlights include a remarkable selection of works by Monet, including the monumental Agapanthus Triptych, reunited specifically for the exhibition, Renoir's Monet Painting in His Garden at Argenteuil and Kandinsky's Murnau The Garden II.

As our galleries are bathed in the colour and light of more than 120 works, see the garden in art with fresh eyes.

Exhibition co-organised by the Royal Academy of Arts and the Cleveland Museum of Art.
