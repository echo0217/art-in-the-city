         'My work is related to the oriental tradition of space, the spiritual concept of space. I am more interested in space from the point of view of nature. Even though my paintings may represent an idea about culture, the main focus is based on nature  I want to reduce the idea and emotion in my work to express only that. I want to reduce and reduce - to create pure emptiness.' Park Seo-Bo ( 2006)

White Cube Mason's Yard is pleased to present an exhibition of paintings by Korean artist Park Seo-Bo, the first solo exhibition of his work in the UK. Alongside Lee Ufan, Park Seo-Bo is widely considered one of the leading figures in contemporary Korean art. Credited as being the father of the 'Dansaekhwa' movement, he is best known for his 'Ecriture' series of paintings which he began in the late-1960s. This exhibition traces the origins of these works and includes 16 paintings made between 1967-81.

The paintings demonstrate the persistence of the monochrome since, despite these regular incisions into the white paint, from a distance they appear to be only one colour, or perhaps, an empty painting. Park's use of white is fundamental, since it acts as a signifier of immateriality in Korea, often representative of sun and light. Conceived in a fleeting moment, Park's calligraphic marks reflect his interest in reaching a sense of 'pure emptiness', an attempt that is made afresh with each new painting.
