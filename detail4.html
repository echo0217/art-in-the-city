        <h3>Maria Hassabi: PLASTIC</h3>
        <h3>February 21, 2016 - March 20, 2016</h3>
        <h3>MoMA</h3>
        
        <p class="big" style="color:#909090">
         Artist and choreographer Maria Hassabi's PLASTIC is a commissioned live installation in which dancers perform throughout MoMA continuously during opening hours. They move between poses at a barely perceptible pace across the Museum's floors and down its staircases. At moments, their positions recall images of bodies in repose, collapse, or transition. With no apparent beginning and end, PLASTIC reformats the duration of theatrical performance into a month-long museum exhibition. Removing the physical distance between audience and performer, Hassabi's sustained movement encourages visitors to closely observe the small shifts in the performers' motions over time. Exploring the tension between stillness and sustained movement, PLASTIC addresses the interface between artistic object and human subject.
