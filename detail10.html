        <h3>Alexander Calder: Performing Sulpture</h3>

         American sculptor Alexander Calder was a radical figure who pioneered kinetic sculpture, bringing movement to static objects. His dynamic works brought to life the avant-garde's fascination with movement, and brought sculpture into the fourth dimension.
Continuing Tate Modern's acclaimed reassessments of key figures in modernism, Alexander Calder: Performing Sculpture will reveal how motion, performance and theatricality underpinned his practice. It will bring together major works from museums around the world, as well as showcasing his collaborative projects in the fields of film, theatre, music and dance.
