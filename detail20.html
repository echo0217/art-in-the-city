        <h3>Kris Yao: Within Without</h3>
        <h3>February 28, 2016 - May 7, 2016</h3>
        <h3>MoCA Shanghai</h3>
        
        <p class="big" style="color:#909090">
         The Museum of Contemporary Art, Shanghai will soon launch Kris Yao's show under the title of "With InÂ·With Out." As a leading architect he was recently awarded an Honarary Fellowship from the American Institute of Architects. He is known for the cultural and emotional richness of his works, Yao is the founder of Kris Yao Artech that gathers leading architects and professionals from Taipei, Shanghai, and other parts of the world. In his thirty-odd years of professional experience, Yao has created works across a variety of architectural types. Recent major works include Lanyang Museum, Wuzhen Theater, Water-Moon Monastery, Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts, Palace Museum Southern Branch, among others. These works have received high acclaim in the industry. Yao is famous for incorporating the humanities and cultural elements into his architecture, which relates to human feelings and emotions in a theatrical and spiritual setting.

The "WithIn WithOut" show offers two themes. The "With In" part provides a range of elements including motion picture, music, and big installations that combine to show the inner thoughts of the Kris Yao. These elements embed the moments of inspiration of the architect that makes the works embody the architect's philosophy and instinct. The "WithOut" part offers selected pieces from Kris Yao, including drawings, documentaries, detailed models, and sketch books. Through the demonstration, the viewer gets to understand not only the professional sphere of the architect, but also the poetic stage on which the architect performs to touch the very souls of the people and to serve the people's lives.
